      <description>Alluvial and Sankey Diagrams The aforementioned plots are methods for visualising the flow of data through a stream of markers. I was motivated to show this because enough of you deal in orders, tickets, and the like the flow visualisation of a system might prove of use. I will work with a familiar dataset. These are data on Admissions at the University of California Berkeley. The data exist as an internal R file in tabular form.</description>

      <description>R Markdown There is detailed help for all that Markdown can do under Help in the RStudio. The key to it is knitting documents with the Knit button in the RStudio. If we use helpers like the R Commander, Radiant, or esquisse, we will need the R code implanted in the Markdown document in particular ways. I will use Markdown for everything. I even use a close relation of Markdown in my scholarly pursuits.</description>

      <description>Scraping NFL data with nflscrapr The nflscrapR package is designed to make data on NFL games more easily available. To install the package, we need to grab it from github.
devtools::install_github(repo = &amp;quot;maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR&amp;quot;) The github page for nflscrapR is quite informative. It has a lot of useful insight for working with the data; the set itself is quite large.
Getting Some Data Following the guide to the package on GitHub, let me try their example.</description>

      <description>cars data I will work with Râ€™s internal dataset on cars: cars. There are two variables in the dataset, this is what they look like.
plot(cars) An Hypothesis Test I will work with the speed variable. The hypothesis to advance is that 17 or greater is the true average speed. The alternative must then be that the average speed is less than 17. Knowing only the sample size, I can figure out what \(t\) must be to reject 17 or greater and conclude that the true average must be less with 90% probability.</description>
