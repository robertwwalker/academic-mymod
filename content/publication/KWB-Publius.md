abstract = "Research suggests that outsourcing is one way that local governments have to
meet rising expectations and unwillingness to pay when resources are constrained. The
degree to which resources are constrained is a function not only of local economic and
political conditions, but of state rules as well. We build on previous models of local
government outsourcing by studying the interaction between state rules and local fiscal,
economic, and political conditions. We find that cities in states that place limits on the
resources available to local governments choose differently from among the constellation of
service provision options than cities in states without such limits."
